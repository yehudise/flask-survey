Hi Harold!

So I was working on this when I was on my break, I worked off of what I learnt and tried to
do the best I could, I was still having a bunch of problems, and since I was on break I was not
allowed to have mentor meeting or on demand mentors. So I used the solution for help, becuase of that 
ths solution used session and th first part of the assignment was to do it without session becuase whe
did not leanr that yet. So I went onto the next section and learnt session and then wrote ut my code with the 
help of the solution. So therefore that is why you will see that I submitted the same project in both 
the session section and the Flask Tools. You will also see that I added a lot of comments to show
my understanding of the material.
Thank you so much!

Best,
Yehudis

Questions I have:
For some reason some times my debugger is showing up and sometimes not, I cannpyt figure out why that is happening?
Also, in my vscode a workspace popped up and I am not sure why that is or what it is and how to get rid of it?
